   ```
   Or drag and drop the file to the `apps/Sub-GHz/` folder on your Flipper Zero

3. **Disconnect and restart** your Flipper Zero
4. **Navigate to Sub-GHz** → **SubGhz Toolkit** in the main menu

### Method 2: Using qFlipper

1. **Open qFlipper** and connect to your Flipper Zero
2. **Navigate to** `Apps` → `Sub-GHz` folder
3. **Upload** the `subghz_toolkit_enhanced.fap` file
4. **Restart** your Flipper Zero

### Method 3: Using Flipper Zero Web Interface

1. **Connect to your Flipper Zero** via web interface
2. **Go to** `Apps` → `Sub-GHz`
3. **Upload** the `subghz_toolkit_enhanced.fap` file
4. **Restart** your Flipper Zero

## 🎯 What's New in the Enhanced Version

### New Analysis Features:
1. **Function Disassembly Analysis** - ARM instruction pattern recognition
2. **Protocol State Analysis** - Memory layout and state machine analysis
3. **Signal Capture Analysis** - Framework for signal analysis
4. **Timing Pattern Analysis** - Protocol timing characteristics
5. **C Header Generation** - Automatic C header file generation

### Enhanced Data Extraction:
- Raw function bytes and ARM patterns
- Protocol state machine mapping
- Timing constants and patterns
- Ready-to-use C structures and types
- Implementation guidance and notes

## 📊 Generated Output Files

When you run the enhanced toolkit, it will create these files on your SD card:

```
/ext/subghz/analysis/
├── function_disassembly.txt      # Function byte analysis
├── protocol_state_analysis.txt   # Decoder state analysis
├── signal_capture_analysis.txt   # Signal capture framework
├── timing_analysis.txt          # Timing pattern analysis
├── protocol_headers.h           # Generated C headers
├── advanced_analysis.txt        # Original comprehensive analysis
└── protocols.txt               # Basic protocol information
```

## 🔧 Usage Workflow

1. **Install the FAP** on your Flipper Zero
2. **Run each analysis tool** from the menu:
   - Function Disassembly
   - Protocol State Analysis
   - Signal Capture Analysis
   - Timing Analysis
   - Generate C Headers
3. **Extract the generated files** from `/ext/subghz/analysis/`
4. **Use the data** to implement protocols in C
5. **Reference the example implementation** for guidance

## 🛠️ Building from Source

If you want to build the FAP yourself:

```bash
# Clone the unleashed firmware
git clone https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware.git

# Copy the source files
cp subghz_toolkit.c unleashed-firmware/applications_user/subghz_toolkit/
cp application.fam unleashed-firmware/applications_user/subghz_toolkit/
cp subghz_toolkit.png unleashed-firmware/applications_user/subghz_toolkit/

# Build the FAP
cd unleashed-firmware
./fbt fap_subghz_toolkit

# The FAP will be in build/f7-firmware-D/.extapps/subghz_toolkit.fap
```

## 📋 System Requirements

- **Flipper Zero** with latest unleashed firmware
- **SD Card** with at least 1MB free space
- **USB connection** for file transfer

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### FAP Not Appearing
- Ensure the file is in the correct folder (`apps/Sub-GHz/`)
- Check that the file extension is `.fap`
- Restart your Flipper Zero after installation

### Analysis Files Not Generated
- Check that your SD card has sufficient free space
- Ensure the `/ext/subghz/` directory exists
- Try running each analysis tool individually

### Build Errors
- Make sure you have the latest unleashed firmware
- Check that all submodules are properly initialized
- Verify that the ARM toolchain is installed
